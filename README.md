# GAME START IMMINANT

The next war will start in 2 hours time, before this time you can set up defences for the game.

gamemode: squirmish; if your main bace is destroyed then the opposing team wins, before the main bace can be taken down all other baces must be destroyed for the shield to go down. you can build up to 3 additionall baces making 7 baces to take down before the last one, but that is costly.

get your defences everyone!!!
